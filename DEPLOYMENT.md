        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```

### Option 2: Netlify (Free, Super Easy)
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Drag and drop your `dist` folder
3. Done! Your site is live instantly

### Option 3: Your Own Server
1. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   build.bat
   
   # Linux/Mac
   ./build.sh
   ```
2. Upload everything from the `dist/` folder to your web server
3. Make sure your server serves `index.html` for all routes

### Option 4: Nginx with SSL (Production Server)
1. See `NGINX_DEPLOYMENT.md` for complete setup guide
2. Quick deployment:
   ```bash
   # Make scripts executable
   chmod +x deploy.sh update.sh
   
   # Deploy to your server
   ./deploy.sh yourdomain.com
   
   # Get SSL certificate
   sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
   ```

### Option 5: Docker (For Advanced Users)
```bash
# Build and run with Docker
docker build -t terminal-screenshot-generator .
docker run -p 80:80 terminal-screenshot-generator
```
