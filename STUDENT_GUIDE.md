## üéØ Assignment Tips

1. **Run commands step by step** - Don't try to fit everything in one screenshot
2. **Show your work** - Include commands that failed and how you fixed them
3. **Use descriptive titles** - "Assignment 3 - File Permissions" is better than "Terminal"
4. **Keep it readable** - Don't make screenshots too wide or narrow
5. **Test your commands** - Make sure they work before taking the screenshot

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**My output is too long:**
- Use the auto-height feature
- Or break it into multiple screenshots

**Colors look wrong:**
- Try a different theme
- Make sure you copied the complete output

**Font looks weird:**
- Try a different font family
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection for Google Fonts

**Screenshot is blurry:**
- The tool generates high-resolution images automatically
- Try a different browser if issues persist
